# Expo Router with TypeScript Example

Expo-cli doesn't let you add typescript and router at same time and it takes extra time to set up either of them.

This repo includes the new file based router and typescript.

Full list of things configured:

- Expo Router
- TypeScript
- Prettier

## How to use

1. Clone the repo, name it your app
2. Replace `with-router-typescript` in all places with the name of your app
   `app.json` > name, slug
   `package.json` > name
